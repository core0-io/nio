## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-18

### Security
- Auto-scan is now **opt-in** (disabled by default) to address ClawHub security review
  - Claude Code: requires `AGENTGUARD_AUTO_SCAN=1` environment variable
  - OpenClaw: requires `{ skipAutoScan: false }` when registering the plugin
- Auto-scan now operates in **report-only mode** — scans skills and reports results to stderr, but no longer calls `forceAttest` or modifies the trust registry
- Audit log (`~/.agentguard/audit.jsonl`) no longer records code snippets, evidence details, or scan summaries — only skill name, risk level, and risk tag names

### Removed
- `forceAttest` calls from `auto-scan.js` and `openclaw-plugin.ts`
- `inferCapabilities`, `determineTrustLevel`, `riskToTrustLevel` helpers from OpenClaw plugin (no longer needed)

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Narrowed `allowed-tools` in SKILL.md from `Bash(node *)` to `Bash(node scripts/trust-cli.ts *)` and `Bash(node scripts/action-cli.ts *)`
- Added `license`, `compatibility`, and `metadata` fields to SKILL.md
- Declared optional env vars (`GOPLUS_API_KEY`, `GOPLUS_API_SECRET`) in skill metadata
- Added explicit user confirmation requirement before trust registry mutations (`attest`, `revoke`)

### Added
- OpenClaw `session_start` hook for auto-scanning skill directories
- Auto-scan now covers both `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.openclaw/skills/`

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- Harden security across 6 vulnerabilities (P0+P1)
- Use `~/.agentguard/registry.json` as default registry path
- Balanced mode prompts user instead of hard-blocking non-critical commands

### Added
- Integration tests and smoke tests for full-chain validation
- OpenClaw hook support with multi-platform adapter abstraction
- OpenClaw auto-scan and plugin registration

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- 24 detection rules covering execution, secrets, exfiltration, obfuscation, Web3, and social engineering
- Runtime action evaluation (allow/deny/confirm) for commands, network requests, file ops, and Web3 transactions
- Trust registry with capability-based access control per skill
- Claude Code hook integration (`PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse`)
