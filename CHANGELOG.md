### Patch Changes

- Features

  Cross-platform MCP tool gate (79941c7) — new mcp key under guard.available_tools / blocked_tools matches parsed MCP tool names across platforms. One entry like blocked_tools.mcp: ['HassTurnOff'] now blocks hass**HassTurnOff on OpenClaw AND mcp**hass**HassTurnOff on Claude Code. Accepts bare tool names (any server) or server-qualified server**tool form.
  sensitive_path_patterns regex field (828022b) — regex companion to the substring-based sensitive_paths. Closes gaps where substring matching can't handle dynamic segments (/abc/<id>/fff), bare-relative paths (raw_files/foo.txt), or case-insensitive variants.
  Fixes

  setup.sh is now a real installer (9d7aef6) — previously only synced files and assumed the plugin was already installed; fresh users hit silent failures where hooks never fired. Now handles three states: fresh install (registers marketplace + runs claude plugin install), stale marketplace path (fixes + reinstalls), and already-installed (syncs cache). Uninstall on both CC + OpenClaw now calls the platform CLIs.
  Docs

  Phase 0 MCP namespace in ARCHITECTURE.md (c85d25a) — documents the per-platform + mcp tool-gate layout.
  config.default.yaml rewritten (bundled with 828022b) — every field under guard.action_guard_rules + file_scan_rules now documents matching semantics, syntax, and examples. Calls out the sensitive_paths leading-slash footgun explicitly.
  ACTION-POLICIES.md "User-Supplied Sensitive Path Patterns" section (bundled with 828022b).
  Tests

  tests (e333088) across 3 new suites — action-guard-rules.test.ts (29), file-scan-rules.test.ts (13), guard-config.test.ts (15). Suite: 444/444 passing (was 387).

- e333088: - **New `action_guard_rules.sensitive_path_patterns` field**: regex companion to the existing substring-based `sensitive_paths`. Closes a gap where the substring matcher (`includes("/" + pattern)` OR `endsWith(pattern)`) couldn't match dynamic path segments (`/abc/<id>/fff`), bare-relative paths anchored at position 0 (`raw_files/foo.txt`), or case-insensitive variants. Accepts the same `/pattern/flags` syntax as other regex fields. Invalid entries are silently skipped.

  - **`config.default.yaml` rewritten**: every field under `guard.action_guard_rules` and `guard.file_scan_rules` now has detailed comments covering purpose+severity, exact matching semantics, regex syntax, and copy-paste examples. The `sensitive_paths` block calls out the leading-slash footgun explicitly (`/etc/` becomes `//etc/` internally and almost never matches — use `etc/`).

  - **`plugins/shared/skill/ACTION-POLICIES.md`**: added "User-Supplied Sensitive Path Patterns" section documenting both layers (substring + regex) and how they feed the `SENSITIVE_PATH` finding.

  - **+57 tests** across 3 new suites — `action-guard-rules.test.ts` (29), `file-scan-rules.test.ts` (13), `guard-config.test.ts` (15) — covering the user-extension path of every previously untested field under `guard.*` (positive, negative, matcher-branch-specific, invalid-regex-skip). Suite is now 444/444 passing (was 387).

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- - **YAML-only config**: runtime config is now exclusively `~/.ffwd-agent-guard/config.yaml`. JSON fallback removed; `setup.sh --reset-config` generates `config.yaml` directly.
  - **`/pattern/flags` regex syntax**: user-supplied regex patterns in config now accept the literal `/pattern/flags` form (e.g. `'/\b(INSERT|UPDATE)\b/i'`) for case-insensitive and other flag combinations. Plain patterns still work for backward compat. Applied everywhere user regex is compiled (Phase 2 runtime + Phase 3 static file_scan_rules).
  - **Config load errors now visible**: YAML syntax errors and Zod validation failures previously failed silently. They now print to stderr and write a `config_error` entry to `~/.ffwd-agent-guard/audit.jsonl`, with per-process dedup. Runtime continues with defaults (fail-open).
  - **`action_guard_rules.secret_patterns` now wired up**: previously declared in the schema but never consumed. User regexes are now evaluated against network request bodies; matches emit a new `SECRET_LEAK_USER` finding (high) with the pattern source in the title.

  - **User `dangerous_patterns` no longer mislabeled**: matches were being reported as `DANGEROUS_COMMAND` / "Dangerous command: pipe to shell" regardless of which user pattern fired. They now have their own rule_id `DANGEROUS_PATTERN` and a title echoing the matching pattern source.
  - **Phase 2 collects all findings per action**: `analyzeBashCommand` no longer short-circuits the function on the first critical hit. Every rule set is evaluated on every command; the decision is unchanged (aggregated score still drives DENY), but audit logs now show every dimension a command touches — better signal for forensics and rule tuning.

  - `plugins/shared/skill/ACTION-POLICIES.md`: documented `DANGEROUS_PATTERN` and `SECRET_LEAK_USER` rule_ids, the `/pattern/flags` syntax, and rewrote "Exec Decision Logic" to reflect the non-short-circuiting behaviour.
  - Various `config.json` → `config.yaml` corrections across `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, plugin SKILL.md files, and `config.schema.json`.

  - +3 suites covering `dangerous_patterns` (5 cases), `secret_patterns` (3 cases), and the shared regex compiler (9 cases). 387/387 passing.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Features

  Add guard.confirm_action config (allow | deny | ask, default allow) to control how each platform handles a confirm decision. Fixes OpenClaw incorrectly blocking the 0.5–0.8 balanced-mode range (no native interactive confirm); Claude Code can also force allow/deny instead of prompting.

  Refactor

  Consolidate skill docs under plugins/shared/skill/ as the single source of truth, synced to both platform plugin dirs during build — eliminates drift between Claude Code and OpenClaw copies.
  Restructure OpenClaw plugin layout: runtime files moved into plugins/openclaw/plugin/ subdir, isolated from skills/ to avoid false positives from OpenClaw's plugin validator.

  Fix

  Release flow now cleans up stale release artifacts before publishing a new version.
